# What is Argo? 

[Argo](/products/argo/) is an open source suite of projects that helps developers deliver software more rapidly and safely. With Argo, you can observe your deployments and release seamlessly. If problems ever arise, Argo is there to help simplify rollbacks as well.  

## The Argo tools

**Argo Workflows and Pipelines** is a container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. 

**Argo Events** is an event-driven workflow automation framework and dependency manager that helps you manage Kubernetes resources, Argo Workflows, and serverless workloads on events from a variety of sources.

**Argo CD** is a GitOps-based continuous deployment tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD integrates with your native continuous integration (CI) systems in Git, and lets developers use the same development, review and approval workflow they already use with Git-based repositories for code.

**[Argo Rollouts](../../quick-start/)** is a progressive delivery controller created for Kubernetes. Argo Rollouts facilitates progressive deployment techniques for rolling updates, including canary deployments, blue/green deployments, A/B tests, and more. 

Within a [GitOps](/learn/kubernetes-glossary/gitops/) context, Argo makes application deployment and lifecycle management easier, particularly as the line between developers and operators disappears, because it automates deployment, makes rollbacks easier and is auditable for easier troubleshooting.
