**The Ambassador Edge Stack is now available and includes additional functionality beyond the current Ambassador API Gateway.**
These features include automatic HTTPS, the Edge Policy Console UI, OAuth/OpenID Connect authentication support, integrated rate
limiting, a developer portal, and [more](/edge-stack-faq/).

## Ambassador API Gateway integrations

If you still want to use just the Ambassador API Gateway, don't worry! The Ambassador API Gateway
is currently available out-of-the-box in some Kubernetes installers and local environments.
