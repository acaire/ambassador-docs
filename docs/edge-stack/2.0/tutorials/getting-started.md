# $productName$ quick start

<Alert severity="info">
  We're pleased to introduce $productName$ 2.0! The 2.X family introduces a number of
  changes to allow $productName$ to more gracefully handle larger installations
  (including multitenant or multiorganizational installations), reduce memory footprint,
  and improve performance. For more information on 2.X, please check the&nbsp;
  <a href="../../release-notes">release notes</a>.

## 1. Installation

We'll start by installing $productName$ into your cluster.

**We recommend using Helm** but there are other options below to choose from.

<GettingStartedEdgeStack20Tabs version="$version$" />

<Alert severity="success"><b>Success!</b> At this point, you have installed $productName$. Now let's get some traffic flowing to your services.</Alert>

## 2. Routing traffic from the edge

$productName$ uses Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to declaratively define its desired state. The workflow you are going to build uses a simple demo app, a **`Listener` CRD**, and a **`Mapping` CRD**. The `Listener` CRD tells $productName$ what port to listen on, and the `Mapping` CRD tells $productName$ how to route incoming requests by host and URL path from the edge of your cluster to Kubernetes services.

1. Start by creating a `Listener` resource for HTTP on port 8080:

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
---
apiVersion: getambassador.io/v3alpha1
kind: Listener
metadata:
  name: $productDeploymentName$-listener-8080
  namespace: $productNamespace$
spec:
  port: 8080
  protocol: HTTP
  securityModel: XFP
  hostBinding:
    namespace:
      from: ALL
---
apiVersion: getambassador.io/v3alpha1
kind: Listener
metadata:
  name: $productDeploymentName$-listener-8443
  namespace: $productNamespace$
spec:
  port: 8443
  protocol: HTTPS
  securityModel: XFP
  hostBinding:
    namespace:
      from: ALL
EOF
```

2. Apply the YAML for the â€œQuote of the Moment" service.

  ```
  kubectl apply -f https://app.getambassador.io/yaml/v2-docs/$ossVersion$/quickstart/qotm.yaml
  ```

  <Alert severity="info">The Service and Deployment are created in your default namespace. You can use <code>kubectl get services,deployments quote</code> to see their status.</Alert>

3. Copy the configuration below and save it to a file called `quote-backend.yaml` so that you can create a Mapping on your cluster. This Mapping tells $productName$ to route all traffic inbound to the `/backend/` path to the `quote` Service.

  ```yaml
  ---
  apiVersion: getambassador.io/v3alpha1
  kind: Mapping
  metadata:
    name: quote-backend
  spec:
    hostname: "*"
    prefix: /backend/
    service: quote
  ```

4. Apply the configuration to the cluster:

  ```
  kubectl apply -f quote-backend.yaml
  ```

  With our Mapping created, now we need to access it!

5. Store the $productName$ load balancer IP address to a local environment variable. You will use this variable to test access to your service.

  ```
  export LB_ENDPOINT=$(kubectl -n $productNamespace$ get svc  $productDeploymentName$ \
    -o "go-template={{range .status.loadBalancer.ingress}}{{or .ip .hostname}}{{end}}")
  ```

6. Test the configuration by accessing the service through the $productName$ load balancer:

  ```
  $ curl -Lki https://$LB_ENDPOINT/backend/

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    content-type: application/json
    date: Wed, 23 Jun 2021 16:49:46 GMT
    content-length: 163
    x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 0
    server: envoy

    {
        "server": "serene-grapefruit-gjd4yodo",
        "quote": "The last sentence you read is often sensible nonsense.",
        "time": "2021-06-23T16:49:46.613322198Z"
    }
  ```

<Alert severity="success"><b>Victory!</b> You have created your first $productName$ Mapping, routing a request from your cluster's edge to a service!</Alert>

* [Intro to Mappings](../../topics/using/intro-mappings/): declaratively routes traffic from
the edge of your cluster to a Kubernetes service
* [Host resource](../../topics/running/host-crd/): configure a hostname and TLS options for your ingress.
