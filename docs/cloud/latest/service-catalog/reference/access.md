# Manage access to Ambassador Cloud

Ambassador Cloud features Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to regulate user permissions.

Roles are accessible in the [Settings section of Ambassador Cloud](https://app.getambassador.io/cloud/settings) on the Members page. Only members with Administrator roles can change other members' roles.

Members can be assigned one of the following roles:
* Administrator - grants member access to all functions in Ambassador Cloud.
* User - has access to all functions in Ambassador Cloud except for the ability to manage other member's accounts or change the [payment plans](https://www.getambassador.io/editions/).
