# Favorites and service view filtering

As your operations scale, it's easy to become overwhelmed by the number of cluster namespaces and services displayed in the Service Catalog view. Learn how to take advantage of Ambassador Cloud's favorites and filtering options to personalize your view and improve your team's workflow.

## Favoriting a service 

On the main Service Catalog view, in the service listing:

1. Find the service you want to add to your favorites.

2. Hover over the service's row to display the flyout buttons.

3. Click the star icon.

</p>

Favorited services are displayed with a star icon next to the service name.

### Filtering the view by favorite services

You can filter your view by favorites service and cells. At the top of the Service Catalog you can select either the Cells of Services dropdown and click **Favorites** to show your favorited services or cells:

</p>

## Favoriting a cell

On the[Cells](../cells) page:

1. Locate the `cell` you want to add to your favorites.

2. Click on the ellipses (...) in the upper-right of a cell to open the cell options, then click **Add to Favorites**.

The favorited `cell` will be displayed with a star icon next to its name.

If you have some `cluster:namespace` favorites, those favorites are migrated to `cell` favorites.
