# Onboarding Dashboard

A central location to check the status of your developers, along with the services within your organization, or the count of telepresence connections to your clusters, depending on your subscription type.

## Onboarding Overview

All members of your organization have the ability to access the dashboard, where they can clearly identify invited developers who have not yet joined, as well as those who have. Furthermore, from this dashboard, you can send invitations to new developers (excluding Developer and Lite subscriptions).
In addition to this, easy access is provided to information about your clusters, as well as the features developed by Ambassador.
